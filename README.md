# Mapping the R package Matrix

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rpy2/rpy2-Matrix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rpy2/rpy2-Matrix)

This Python package is an extension to `rpy2` mapping the R package `Matrix`.

To install from the Github repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rpy2/rpy2-Matrix#egg=rpy2-Matrix
```

At the time of writing, documentation is only in docstrings, and as examples in the [unit tests](rpy2_Matrix/tests).
